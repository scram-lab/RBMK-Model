# RBMK-Model
An OpenMC model of the RBMK reactor core. This model uses the OpenMC RBMK fuel bundle example and creates a lattice based on the core design in order to create an approximation of the original design. This is a very simplified design using solid homogeneous control rods and solid concrete bricks.
