## Folders
The **Model** folder contains the RBMK core model in a jupyter notebook file
The **Analysis** folder will contain the analysis to be performed on the core

## References
The geometry of this model is based off of dimensions from a paper looking into the design features and reasons for accident by Mikhail V. Malko  
https://www.rri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/NSRG/reports/kr79/kr79pdf/Malko1.pdf  
The core lattice arrangement comes from the paper A simplified analysis of the Chernobyl Accident by Bertrand Mercier https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S2491929221000078

## Instructions
The model should be able to be run as long as the user has installed openmc and it is running properly. The model is a jupyter notebook file and it is intended to be run in jupyter notebook. The model currently produces the component and core geometries.
